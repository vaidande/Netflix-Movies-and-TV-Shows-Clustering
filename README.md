# Netflix-Movies-and-TV-Shows-Clustering

As movie industry is evolving into streaming platforms, thereâ€™s no doubt that Netflix has become one of the important platforms for streaming. The dataset that we have used for EDA and clustering has been collected by Flixable, a third-party Netflix search engine. There are 12 features and around 7700 observations in the dataset and are mostly textual features 

Our main objectives of this project are to do exploratory analysis and find useful insights from dataset, to understand what type content is available in different countries, also to find out is Netflix has increasingly focused on TV rather than movies in recent years and at last to do clustering of similar 
content by matching text-based features from dataset.
